# CodeReviewTest
How would you improve this part of code ?

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the `CodeReviewTest` project.

I started this project to ask a review from interviews with developers. I want to know what they think of this code and mostly how would they improve it.

## Technical precision

The project can be run on Windows using Visual Studio. The code is made using C# but the majority of the flaws can be found in others languages.

It consists of 3 simple classes using a few basic aspects of C# syntax.
The only interesting file is `Program.cs` where all the code is put.

The `Program.Main()` method is mandatory so there is no need to try to improve it unlike the rest of the file.

## Purpose

The main goal is to assess if the developer can :

- Understand the code - maybe the most important thing here. The code is totally new to them but they need to be able to understand what it does and how it works.
- Find out the flaws - there are several potentials issues and a few ways to fix them.
- Improve it - the ultimate things is to improve the code by make it more robust and clearer.

Have fun \o/
