# CodeReviewTest
How would you improve this part of code ?

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the `CodeReviewTest` project.

I started this project to ask a review from interviews with developers. I want to know what they think of this code and mostly how would they improve it.

The functional part must not be changed. Try to understand what it does and make it better.

## Technical precision

The project can be run on Windows using Visual Studio. The code is made using C# but the majority of the flaws can be found in others languages.

It consists of 3 simple classes using a few basic aspects of C# syntax.
The only interesting file is `Program.cs` where all the code is put.

The `Program.Main()` method is mandatory so there is no need to try to improve it unlike the rest of the file.

## Purpose

The main goal is to assess if the developer can :

- Understand the code - maybe the most important thing here. The code is totally new to them but they need to be able to understand what it does and how it works.
- Find out the flaws - there are several potentials issues and a few ways to fix them.
- Improve it - the ultimate things is to improve the code by make it more robust and clearer.

Have fun \o/
